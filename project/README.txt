These are the instructions to run our project:

1. Open a terminal/console on the location of this folder (the one that contains the project source code).
2. Start a local python server, use ONE of the following commands (it depends on the Python version):
	python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888
 	python â€“m http.server 8888 &
3. Open or select the project.html file in a browser ( or access directly through the link: http://localhost:8888/project.html )
4. Now the dashboard should be displayed with all the views on their default state.
5. For an optimized experience, the browser should be in fullscreen mode (pressing F11 does that on some browsers) and the resolution should be 1920x1080.
